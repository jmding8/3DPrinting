#3DPrinting
##Educational material pertaining to 3d printing, from basic to advanced topics.

###Mission
3D printers are incredibly useful and flexible tools, but are also finicky and tricky to operate. Information is often scattered, and it is often difficult to identify reliable sources. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a central location where the community of people interested in 3d printing can curate, collect and organize relevant and reliable information to serve as a "source of truth" for those looking to learn about 3d printing.
